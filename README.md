## **Introduction**
We, Adhan Razzaque, Kahmrin Traylor, and Brandon McGee, have created this website to ilustrate our skills in Github and Markdown. This particular website is designed to encourage Gamestop to advertise PS4s more as they are more popular and would gather more sales. Here on this website you will find various large data sets to support our conclusion, and show we understand Big Data Analytics.

## **Area of Focus**
