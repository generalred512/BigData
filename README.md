# **Battle of The Consoles**
## **Introduction**
We, Adhan Razzaque, Kahmrin Traylor, and Brandon McGee, have created this website to ilustrate our skills in Github and Markdown. This particular website is designed to encourage Gamestop to advertise PS4s more as they are more popular and would gather more sales. Here on this website you will find various large data sets to support our conclusion, and show we understand Big Data Analytics.

## **Area of Focus**
We decided to explore the game industry, as each of us has experience in the subject. Specifically, we chose the difference between the three biggest consoles currently, Xbox One, PS4, and Switch, since we have played on, and are knowledgeable with, each of the consoles. 

## **Our Questions**
1. What console is consistently the most popular?
2. Do consoles peak during anytime in the year?
3. Why do consoles peak in popularity during certain times of year?

## **Data**

## Explanation of Individual Report
On your own, respond directly to each of the following prompts: 

Investigation
1.	Explain why your questions are rich enough and your data set(s) are large enough to require the use of computation to analyze the data and answer your questions. Your explanation should be **no more than 200 words.** 
2.	Explain why your group selected the data set(s) used in your investigation. Your explanation should be **no more than 200 words.** 
3.	Describe and justify the specific computational tools (visualization software, spreadsheet, statistical package, etc.) and techniques (filtering, clustering, visualizing, analyzing, etc.) your group used. Provide a detailed description of how your group processed the information in the data set(s) to conduct the investigation and how this process enabled you to meet your objective of gaining insight and knowledge. This description should be sufficiently detailed to make it clear that you could conduct the investigation on your own. It should also include sufficient detail to allow a reasonably skilled reader to use the tools and techniques to replicate the investigation and verify the results. Your description should be **no more than 700 words;** the following questions may help guide your writing. 
  - What challenges did you face in finding the data sources?
  - Did the data require any filtering or cleaning? If so, how did you process the data?
