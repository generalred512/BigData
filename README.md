# **Battle of The Consoles**
## **Introduction**
We, Adhan Razzaque, Kahmrin Traylor, and Brandon McGee, have created this website to ilustrate our skills in Github and Markdown. This particular website is designed to encourage Gamestop to advertise PS4s more as they are more popular and would gather more sales. Here on this website you will find various large data sets to support our conclusion, and show we understand Big Data Analytics.

## **Area of Focus**
We decided to explore the game industry, as each of us has experience in the subject. Specifically, we chose the difference between the three biggest consoles currently, Xbox One, PS4, and Switch, since we have played on, and are knowledgeable with, each of the consoles. 

## **Our Questions**
3.	List the set of three to five questions you sought to answer. 

## **Data**
4.	Identify each permanent data set you used. For each set, you must: 
  - Provide the permanent URL.

  - Briefly describe the data set. In this data set, the information given is the shows us the amount of times a certain console was searched in the past year by americans. This graph shows us which console is searched the most (ps4) and from that we can assume that, that console is the most popular in this country
  - Provide the date on which you accessed each data set. 
  
## **Answers**
5.	Clearly present the answer to each of the questions you investigated. Each answer should be **no more than 200 words.** Attach and reference any appropriate non-textual representations. Include a one sentence description of each non-textual attachment. 

## **How do the questions relate to this?**
6.	Explain how your questions and answers contribute to the development of insight and knowledge in your chosen area of inquiry. Your explanation should be: **Our questions relate to our main to to advertise ps4â€™s more, because from our research, the ps4 is the most searched (popular) console out of the nintendo switch and xbox 1. Attach (as pdfs) and reference any appropriate non-textual representations. Include a one-sentence description of each non-textual attachment.

## Explanation of Individual Report
On your own, respond directly to each of the following prompts: 

Investigation
1.	Explain why your questions are rich enough and your data set(s) are large enough to require the use of computation to analyze the data and answer your questions. Your explanation should be **no more than 200 words.** 
2.	Explain why your group selected the data set(s) used in your investigation. Your explanation should be **no more than 200 words.** 
3.	Describe and justify the specific computational tools (visualization software, spreadsheet, statistical package, etc.) and techniques (filtering, clustering, visualizing, analyzing, etc.) your group used. Provide a detailed description of how your group processed the information in the data set(s) to conduct the investigation and how this process enabled you to meet your objective of gaining insight and knowledge. This description should be sufficiently detailed to make it clear that you could conduct the investigation on your own. It should also include sufficient detail to allow a reasonably skilled reader to use the tools and techniques to replicate the investigation and verify the results. Your description should be **no more than 700 words;** the following questions may help guide your writing. 
  - What challenges did you face in finding the data sources?
  - Did the data require any filtering or cleaning? If so, how did you process the data?
